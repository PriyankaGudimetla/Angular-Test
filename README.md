# Angular-Challange

## Description

Originally I wanted to build an web page application that allows  users to pull data based on their account number and can display the account number and its available cash and also by clicking the account number and the available cash we can sort the details in ascending order or descending order. 

Displayed the available cash as percent and dollar in green, red, or gray, depending on whether the percent change is positive, negative, or zero. If it is positive or negative, display a single plus-sign or
minus-sign.


## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js installed on your environement.

### Node

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).
You should be able to run the following command after the installation procedure
below.

    $ node --version
    v12.16.1
    $ npm --version
    6.13.4

## Installation

- Clone the repo in your terminal by clicking the _green_ clone or download button at the top right and copyin the url
- In your terminal, type ```git clone URL```
- This will copy all the files from this repo down to your computer
- In your terminal, cd into the directory you just created
- Type ```npm install``` to install all dependencies
- Last,type ```npm start or ng serve``` to run the app locally.

- To look at the code, just open up the project in your favorite code editor!

# Getting started

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally. We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. you can install it from [Here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), then run `yarn install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
